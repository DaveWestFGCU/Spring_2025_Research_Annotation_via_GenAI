      "First, the context is World Book Day, which is all about promoting reading and books. So the general vibe here is positive because people are celebrating books. The user is talking about \"amazing books that have been reading pleasures as well as influencers.\" That sounds like they're enjoying these books and maybe recommending them to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They list \"Animal Farm\" by George Orwell, which is a classic novel known for its political themes but also widely respected. The mention of it in the tweet suggests the user holds it in high regard. There's no negative language here; instead, it's all about appreciation and influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or others. Since the tweet is sharing something they love and appreciate, the emotion seems to be positive. The word \"pleasures\" indicates enjoyment, which aligns with joy. There's no indication of any other emotions like fear or surprise.\n",

The user is talking about how it's been over 24 hours and the media might be moving on, but they want to remind people that an 800-year-old building, which was a beacon of hope for many, burned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll break down the tweet. They mention the age of the building and its significance as a symbol of hope. The fact that it's been over a day suggests they're frustrated with how quickly attention is shifting away from the event. This frustration could be linked to anger or maybe sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of words like \"burned down\" indicates destruction, which often evokes strong emotions. Since the author is emphasizing the loss and the historical importance of the cathedral, I'm leaning towards sadness because they're highlighting the tragedy and expressing grief over the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there's also a hint of frustration with the media's coverage, which might point to anger. But the primary emotion seems to be about the destruction itself rather than the media's reaction.

      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other emotions like fear or surprise, but those don't seem to fit here. The tweet isn't expressing fear about future events or surprise at the occurrence; it's more about the aftermath and the emotional weight of losing something significant.\n",

The text says: \"Educating for Extinction. (climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system)\" with several hashtags related to climate issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll break down the content. The phrase \"Educating for Extinction\" sounds pretty intense. It suggests that current educational practices might be leading towards extinction, possibly implying that things are getting worse or that there's a lack of effective action. The mention of climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system adds to the sense that systems aren't working well and that things are breaking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the hashtags: #ExtinctionRebellion, which is another movement focused on stopping mass extinction events; #GretaThunberg, obviously related to her activism; and others like #creativelearning, #pedagogy, #education, #climatestrike. These seem to tie into themes of environmental crisis and educational issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the emotions associated with these terms. Climate change is a serious issue that often evokes fear because it's about the future, survival, and catastrophic events. The use of \"Extinction\" in both the tweet title and hashtags emphasizes the urgency and seriousness, which can lead people to feel anxious or afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any words indicating joy, anger might be present but more as a reaction to frustration, but the primary emotion here seems to be fear because it's about something terrible happening. There's no clear indication of surprise or disgust; it's more about conveying the severity and urgency of climate change.\n",

The author is expressing a desire for something positive to happen—specifically, they're hoping that Mohamed Salah will score three goals (a hat trick) in the second leg of a match. This seems like a supportive and optimistic statement.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the tweet: \"#GameofThrones is my forever obsession & guilty pleasure!! ❤️❤️❤️\". The user starts by calling GoT their \"forever obsession\" and a \"guilty pleasure.\" These terms suggest a strong personal connection and maybe even a bit of excitement or passion. \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of multiple heart emojis (❤️) definitely adds an emotional layer, likely indicating love or affection. The word \"obsession\" can sometimes carry a negative connotation, but in this context, it's paired with \"guilty pleasure,\" which usually implies something enjoyable that one might feel sheepish about liking. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it together, the user is expressing deep enthusiasm and affection for the show. They're not just talking about it; they're gushing with emojis, which are a clear indicator of positive emotions. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or disgust here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion categories: joy seems to fit best because the tweet is filled with excitement and love. The other options don't quite match—anger isn't present, nor is fear or surprise. Sadness doesn't apply either since there's a positive tone throughout.\n",

      "\n",
      "The user starts with \"Yes - and....\" which seems positive but then continues. The next part says, \"Happy we value our heritage sites.\" So they're expressing happiness about valuing these sites. Then they make a connection: \"May we also value each other-and the planet-as much and urgently?\" Here, they're linking the importance of valuing people and the environment to the same level as heritage sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "They go on to say, \"Otherwise it all collapses, fades to black.\" That's a bit ominous, suggesting negative consequences if we don't. Then they state, \"Reality: can't have one without all others.\" This emphasizes interconnectedness but ends with a cautionary note.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hashtags are #NotreDameCathedralFire, which is the event, and others like #leadership, #values, #UNESCO, which relate to cultural heritage and values.\n",

      "Looking at the emotions: The user starts with happiness about valuing heritage sites. Then they express a desire for others to be valued as well, showing care and concern. However, the latter part talks about collapse if we don't value these things, which introduces fear or anxiety about potential negative outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But overall, the main emotion seems to be sadness because they're reflecting on the loss of such an important site and expressing a sense of grief for what's been lost. They also tie it to broader issues, which adds depth but still centers around a feeling of loss and sorrow.\n",

      "First, looking at the words used: \" USER USER Shes not & youd know that...\" It seems like they're addressing someone else, maybe correcting them. The mention of regime change and the aftermath suggests concern or frustration about the situation. The hashtags and link might be pointing out some information but the tone here is more critical.\n",
      "\n",

      "Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or others.

      "\n",
      "First, I notice the strong negative language here—\"ugliest\" is a pretty harsh word. That suggests some sort of dislike or aversion. The mention of it being against Liverpool, his former club, adds context. Usually, when a player returns to their old team, there's a lot of emotion involved—often positive, like nostalgia or excitement. But in this case, the tweet is expressing the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user seems upset about how Suarez celebrated. Maybe they feel that the celebration was inappropriate or disrespectful towards Liverpool. This could stem from feelings of betrayal or anger. The use of \"ugliest\" isn't just about the action itself but also conveys a strong negative emotion towards Suarez's behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the mapping guidelines, if the tweet shows secondary emotions like dislike or loathing, it falls under disgust. Here, the user clearly dislikes what they saw and is expressing aversion towards Suarez's celebration. There's no indication of other emotions like fear or surprise; it's purely a negative reaction focused on dislike.\n",

      "The tweet expresses that people will miss an important piece of history and Christianity during the rebuilding process. The word \"missing\" suggests a sense of loss or absence, which is often associated with sadness.

      "First, let's break down the content. The tweet is responding to people who dismiss the cathedral as \"just a building.\" The author is clearly reacting to those comments. Using words like \"heartless\" shows strong disapproval or dislike towards those individuals. They also mention praying that others realize the bigger picture, which implies they're emphasizing the emotional and cultural significance of the event beyond just the physical structure.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, \"#Venezuela Correcting manipulation. Armoured car RUN OVER helpless citizens.\" There's also a link included, but since I can't click on links, I'll focus on the text provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context given mentions that Venezuela has been in a presidential crisis since January 10th, 2019, with people divided between supporting Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido. This adds background to the tweet's potential sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the tweet itself, the key words are \"manipulation,\" \"armoured car,\" and \"RUN OVER helpless citizens.\" The use of all caps in \"RUN OVER\" suggests emphasis or strong emotion. The phrase \"helpless citizens\" indicates vulnerability, which might evoke feelings of sadness or concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author is likely expressing outrage over the situation described—armored cars running over people seems like a violent act. Outrage can fall under anger because it's a strong negative emotion directed at something perceived as wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider if there are other emotions that fit better. Disgust might come into play with \"manipulation,\" but the primary reaction to violence is more likely anger. Fear could be involved, but the tweet doesn't explicitly express fear; instead, it's more about the act itself being a cause for anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be anger due to the violent act described and the emphasis on correcting manipulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I notice the main topic seems to be about funding priorities. The title suggests frustration or criticism towards how resources are allocated—money is available for war but not for feeding the poor. This could indicate anger because it's pointing out a disparity that the author might find unjust or upsetting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inclusion of #NotreDameCathedralFire adds context, possibly linking the discussion to current events, but the main focus seems to be on wealth distribution and political issues (Brexit, Farage).

      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: anger includes annoyances or rage. Here, the author is pointing out what they see as a problem with resource allocation, which could stem from frustration or anger towards those in power or societal priorities.\n",

      "There's no clear expression of other emotions like fear, joy, etc., so it doesn't fit into those categories. The primary emotion seems to be directed at the situation described—allocation of funds for war over feeding the poor—which is a strong statement likely expressing anger.\n",

      "The phrase \"messing with USER\" is interesting. It could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, if the user is saying Messi is messing with them, maybe they're frustrated or annoyed because of something he did.

      "\n",
      "Looking at the context, Game of Thrones is known for its intense storylines and character deaths, so it's common for fans to have strong reactions. The use of \"hit me the hardest\" indicates that the death was impactful for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word \"fuck\" here is a sign of frustration or anger. It's often used when someone is upset or annoyed. So combining these elements, the emotion seems to be anger because they're expressing dissatisfaction and frustration over Theon's death.\n",

      "I don't think it's disgust because there's no indication of dislike towards something else. Fear isn't present either; it's more about the emotional impact rather than fear.

      "First, let's break down what the user is expressing here. They start by saying it was a \"great episode,\" which immediately makes me think they're happy or satisfied with the show. That's a positive emotion, probably joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then there's a转折点 (a turning point) in their statement: \"but honestly.\" This indicates that while they thought the episode was great, they have some reservations or a different opinion about it. They compare two specific battles: #BattleoftheBastards and #BattleofWinterfell, stating that the former is better than the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the user is expressing their preference for one battle over another. Now, I need to determine what emotion this comparison conveys. Is it anger? Disgust? Fear? Joy? Sadness? Surprise? Or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial part of the tweet is clearly positive—joy. But then they express a personal opinion about which battle was better. This isn't necessarily an emotion; it's more of a critique or a preference. They're not expressing strong negative feelings like anger or disgust, nor are they showing fear, sadness, or surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They might be disappointed that the latest battle wasn't as good as the previous one, but disappointment can sometimes fall under sadness. However, in this context, they're not explicitly stating that they feel sad; instead, they're making a comparison based on their opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the primary emotion is happiness about the episode, and then a critique of a specific part, I think the main emotion here is joy because the tweet starts with a positive statement. The rest is more about personal preference rather than an overriding emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user's overall sentiment towards the episode is positive—they called it \"great.\" Their critique of the battle doesn't negate that initial positive feeling. So, the primary emotion is joy.\n",

      "So, even though the word \"love\" is there, the overall sentiment seems negative.

      "\n",
      "I don't think it's disgust because that usually involves feelings like dislike or aversion towards something, but here it's more about the inconvenience and difficulty in viewing.

However, the tweet also highlights one character standing out and uses a positive hashtag like #girlpower, which might indicate some positivity or empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary emotion here seems to be sadness because the focus is on the loss of beloved characters, which typically evokes a feeling of sorrow. The mention of girl power could add another layer, but it's more about celebrating a character rather than overriding the overall sad tone. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's nothing negative about the characters themselves, just their loss.

      "First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The hashtag #Venezuela indicates it's related to events happening there. The main message is \"When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right,\" which seems to be a strong statement against oppressive rule. It references Simon Bolivar, who was a prominent Venezuelan revolutionary leader known for his fight against Spanish colonialism and advocacy for freedom and independence.\n",

      "The phrase \"tyranny becomes law\" suggests that the current government is seen as tyrannical or oppressive.

      "Now, mapping this to emotions: The primary emotion seems to be disgust. Disgust often involves feelings of aversion or dislike towards something perceived as immoral, harmful, or repulsive. In this case, the author is expressing strong disapproval and condemnation of Greta's family's parenting style, which they equate with child abuse.\n",

      "First, let's break down the content. The author mentions taking time to read a book for fun and refers to it as self-care. Reading is often associated with relaxation and enjoyment, which are positive feelings. The use of \"fun\" in quotes might indicate that they're highlighting reading as an enjoyable activity amidst a busy schedule.\n",
      "\n",

      "Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, others. Since the tweet is about finding joy in reading and self-care, it's likely pointing towards a positive emotion. Joy would fit here because reading for fun is portrayed as something that brings happiness and well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any signs of negative emotions like anger or sadness. The tone is uplifting and encouraging. There's no indication of surprise or fear; it's more about the personal satisfaction from reading. So, the primary emotion conveyed is joy.\n",

      "\n",

      "- Surprise: Distraction or amazement.\n",
      "- Others: No emotion, multiple emotions, or unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet is making a comparison. It doesn't explicitly express any strong emotion like anger or joy. Instead, it's pointing out the similarity between Macron's statement and a religious one. The user might be impressed by the boldness of the claim or perhaps finding it somewhat surprising that such a comparison is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, could there be an underlying emotion? Maybe the tweet is expressing admiration for Macron's determination, which would lean towards joy. Alternatively, if the comparison is meant to highlight the enormity of the task, maybe it's more about surprise because it's unexpected or impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the primary emotion isn't explicitly stated and the tweet is more analytical or making a clever point, it might not fit neatly into any of the main categories.

      "\n",
      "I'm trying to understand the emotion behind this. Is she angry? Maybe she's frustrated with how certain groups are communicating, especially on social media. But wait, she's addressing minors specifically, so perhaps she's concerned or advising them. Alternatively, could it be a sarcastic remark?\n",

They also mention that every MP should have been present at the debate, which implies they're disappointed or upset that not everyone attended. However, disappointment isn't one of the primary emotions listed; it falls under secondary emotions like anger or sadness.\n",

      "Next, the author states that a Climate Emergency must be declared. This shows concern and urgency about climate issues, which could relate to fear (apprehension) or maybe even surprise if they're highlighting something unexpected.

      "\n",
      "Looking at the hashtags: #ExtinctionRebellion, #GretaThunberg, and #LabourGreenRebellion.

      "The author is expressing support for the speaker's message and agreeing with the need for a Climate Emergency declaration.

      "First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says, \"Thrilling to see Venezuelans rise from the oppression of Socialism. Freedom is the natural condition of mankind.

      "\n",
      "The key part here is where she says \"Sad, would love to see you perform around the world.\" So she explicitly states that she feels sad because she wants to watch the artist perform globally but can't due to them not being able to fly anymore. \n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says: \"#WorldBookDay Who is absolute divine? What is her name? How is her devotion All the information will be known. Human life will be successful.\" The user also provided context about World Book Day being an event by UNESCO to promote reading and books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the tweet, it seems to be asking questions about someone described as \"absolute divine\" and expressing that all information will be known, leading to successful human life. The tone here is somewhat mysterious and intriguing. The use of words like \"divine,\" \"devotion,\" and \"successful\" suggests a positive or hopeful sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to determine the primary emotion. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or others. The tweet doesn't express any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's not showing fear or sadness either. There's no clear indication of surprise because it's more about posing questions rather than reacting to something unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closest emotion here might be joy, as the tweet seems to convey a sense of positivity and hope regarding knowledge and human life. However, since the primary focus is on seeking information and promoting success through knowledge, which aligns with the purpose of World Book Day, it's more about celebration or enthusiasm rather than pure joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that the tweet is asking questions without expressing strong emotions, maybe it's not fitting into any of the primary categories. It could be seen as neutral or informative, which would fall under \"others.\" But I'm leaning towards joy because the overall message seems positive and encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the guidelines mention that if the emotion isn't clear or is a mix, we should classify it as others. Since the tweet's main purpose is to inform or celebrate rather than express a dominant emotion, perhaps \"others\" is more appropriate here.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tweet says, \"Anybody got a hug they can spare? #shook #gameofthrones #avengersendgame.\" The use of the word \"shook\" is interesting. I know that \"shook\" can mean being emotionally affected, often in a negative way, like scared or upset. But sometimes it's used more casually to express being impressed or moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the hashtags, they're using both GOT and Endgame, which are two major franchises with large fanbases. The user is combining watching these two shows, which might mean they had an intense emotional experience. They're asking for a hug, which suggests they need comfort, possibly because they were scared or felt something really strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary emotion here seems to be fear because \"shook\" often relates to feeling scared or anxious. Alternatively, it could be sadness if the ending of GOT was particularly upsetting, but given that they also watched Endgame, which is known for its emotional and intense scenes, especially in the last part, maybe the user felt a mix of emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the main emotion conveyed by \"shook\" leans more towards fear or anxiety, I think the primary emotion here is fear. They might have been scared by the events in both shows or felt overwhelmed by the experience.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I should consider what emotions might be associated with being reported frequently but not finding any issues. The person is likely frustrated because their tweets are getting reported, which could mean they're being targeted or that there's some form of suppression. However, since Twitter didn't find any violations, the frustration isn't about being wrong but perhaps about the process itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frustration can sometimes fall under anger, especially if it's a strong feeling of irritation or exasperation. The person might feel annoyed or irritated by the situation—having their content reported repeatedly without any resolution.

      "\n",
      "I don't see elements of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise here. There's no clear indication of fear (like anxiety), nor is there a positive emotion like joy. Sadness might come into play if they're feeling down about their content being flagged, but the primary emotion seems more irritation than deep sorrow.\n",

      "The tweet says, \"All hail the many faced God Arya Stark. She is forever that bitch! #GameOfThrones.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the words used: \"hail\" and \"many faced God\" seem to be赞美，praising Arya as a powerful figure. But then it switches with \"forever that bitch,\" which has a negative connotation. The word \"bitch\" is often used derogatorily, so that's a strong indicator of some negative emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the context: Game of Thrones is known for its complex characters and intense storylines. Arya Stark is a fan-favorite character, known for her strength and development throughout the series. So, when someone refers to her as \"that bitch,\" it might be expressing frustration or disappointment with how she was portrayed in the last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user is using both praise (\"hail\") and criticism (\"bitch\"). This mix could indicate a few emotions. The praise suggests admiration, but the insult points towards something else. Maybe the author felt let down by Arya's character development in the final season, leading to disappointment or sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the mapping guidelines: Sadness is associated with pensiveness or grief. If the tweet expresses disappointment or dissatisfaction, that could fall under sadness. Alternatively, if it were more about anger or frustration, it might be classified as anger. But here, the use of \"bitch\" seems more like a critique rather than outright anger.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let's break down the words used. The word \"disappointed\" is a strong indicator of emotion. Disappointment typically falls under sadness because it's a feeling of dissatisfaction or sorrow due to unmet expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the context, the user is expressing that they're disappointed the fire didn't destroy the cathedral completely. This suggests they might have wanted something more dramatic or perhaps felt that the event wasn't as significant as it could have been. However, disappointment itself is a form of sadness because it's about not getting what one hoped for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider other possible emotions. Could this be anger? Maybe frustration, but \"disappointed\" isn't exactly rage. Dislike or disgust? Not really, since the emotion here seems more about unmet expectations rather than dislike. Fear? No, there's no indication of fear in the tweet. Joy and surprise are out of the question.\n",

      "I'm trying to determine the emotion here. It doesn't seem like anger or sadness because there's no direct expression of those feelings. Instead, the tone seems more reflective and thoughtful.

Alternatively, it could be surprise if they're highlighting something unexpected.\n",
