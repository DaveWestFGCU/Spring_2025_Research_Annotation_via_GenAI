You are given a tweet. Your task is to identify the primary emotion the author intended to convey in the tweet and classify it using one of the following labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise or others.

Mapping Guidelines:
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to annoyance or rage, classify it as anger.
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to disinterest, dislike, or loathing, classify it as disgust.
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to apprehension, anxiety, or terror, classify it as fear.
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to serenity or ecstasy, classify it as joy.
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to pensiveness or grief, classify it as sadness.
If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to distraction or amazement, classify it as surprise.
If the tweet conveys no emotion, there are multiple emotions with no dominant one expressed, or more context is needed to determine the emotion, classify it as others.

Your response must ONLY consist of one word: the chosen emotion label from the list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or others. Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or additional text. Output NOTHING but that one label.
